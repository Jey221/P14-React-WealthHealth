## package packTable version 1.0.3

# Description

This package is a part of the project 14 of the OpenClassrooms "Front End Developer" courses.
For this one I had to turn an old JQuery website into a full react app.

If you want to see the rest of the project it's right there : https://github.com/Jey221/front
the React component on npm as a package : https://www.npmjs.com/package/packtable
I choose to make a react table component as an npm package.

# Requirements

node: v16.13.2
react: 18.2.0
styled-components: 5.3.10

# Installation

run the following command:
`npm i packtable`

you need to define the following useState `const [employees, updateEmployees] = useState([])` where you use the component

# Dependencies
